## Setup
To run this program:

## How it works
The program automates the process of getting reports about the farm on how much milk is produced per shed and the total amount of milk produced by all sheds.

The program has a function that takes in a buying rate as one of its arguments and gives you a report on how much you will earn on a weekly,monthly or yearly basis.
